# stock-check

There's way too many scalpers taking the PS5 stock, so this is leveling the playing field for the gamers who desparately need their PS5 :-)

## Usage

```
yarn start
```

You'll get notified in the console and a screenshot taken to show you the state of the store that had it in stock (for confirmation).
